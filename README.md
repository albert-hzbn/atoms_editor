# AtomForge

AtomForge is an interactive atomic structure builder for metallurgical simulation and atomistic modeling. It is designed to help researchers and engineers create, edit, inspect, and export structures used in molecular dynamics (MD) and first-principles workflows.

## Highlights

- Build structures from scratch using crystal-aware workflows for bulk crystals, substitutional solid solutions, cubic grain boundaries, and nanocrystals.
- Generate Wulff-construction nanocrystals from periodic reference structures, including non-cubic systems, with symmetry-expanded facet previews.
- Generate custom finite structures by filling imported 3D mesh volumes with atoms from a reference crystal.
- Combine multiple loaded structures in a dedicated 3D Merge Structures workflow with per-structure transform gizmos.
- Create polycrystalline microstructures via Voronoi grain construction.
- Analyze local order with common neighbour analysis (CNA) and radial distribution function (RDF) tools.
- Export structures for simulation (VASP and other supported formats).
- Export publication-ready images (PNG, JPEG, SVG), including high-resolution scaling.
- Use dark/light themes with HiDPI-aware UI scaling for readable overlays and dialogs.

## Platform support

- Linux
- Windows (MSYS2 UCRT64 / MinGW-w64)

For dependency lists, build commands, portable packaging, and troubleshooting see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Supported formats

Structure files (open/save): `.xyz`, `.cif`, `.pdb`, `.sdf`, `.mol`, `.vasp`, `.mol2`, `.pwi`, `.gjf`

Rendered image export: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`

You can also open a structure at launch by passing a file path, for example:

```bash
AtomForge structure.cif
```

## Command-line interface (CLI)

AtomForge also supports headless structure generation through `--build` modes.

```bash
AtomForge --build <mode> [options] --output <file>
```

Available modes:

- `bulk`: build a bulk crystal from lattice + space-group input
- `gb`: build a CSL grain-boundary bicrystal from an input structure
- `poly`: generate a Voronoi polycrystal from an input structure
- `nano`: carve a nanocrystal from an input structure
- `amorphous`: pack an amorphous structure by random sequential addition
- `sss`: generate a substitutional solid solution from a host structure
- `custom`: fill an OBJ/STL mesh volume with atoms from a reference crystal

Examples:

```bash
AtomForge --build gb --input cu.cif --axis "0 0 1" --sigma 5 --plane 0 --uca 3 --ucb 3 --vacuum 5.0 --output cu_sigma5_gb.cif
AtomForge --build custom --input cu.cif --mesh bunny.obj --scale 20 --vacuum 5 --output cu_bunny.xyz
```

For per-mode help:

```bash
AtomForge --help bulk
AtomForge --help gb
AtomForge --help poly
AtomForge --help nano
AtomForge --help amorphous
AtomForge --help sss
AtomForge --help custom
```

## Main workflows

### Open and inspect

1. Use File -> Open.
2. Navigate with rotate/zoom controls.
3. Toggle View -> Show Bonds and View -> Show Element as needed.
4. Open View -> Structure Info for composition, lattice, positions, and symmetry.

### Edit structure data

- Right-click a selection to substitute atoms, insert midpoint atoms, measure, or delete.
- Use Edit -> Edit Structure to modify lattice vectors and atom positions.
- Use Edit -> Atomic Sizes and Edit -> Element Colors to adjust visual properties.
- Use Edit -> Transform Structure to apply a 3x3 matrix to periodic structures.
- Use Edit -> Merge Structures to load, arrange, and merge multiple structures in an interactive 3D preview.

### Build structures

- **Bulk Crystal**: Create periodic cells from crystal system, space group, lattice parameters, and asymmetric-unit atoms.
- **Substitutional Solid Solution**: Randomly substitute element species on the lattice sites of a host structure to match a user-defined target composition, specified in atomic percent with live integer-count feedback.
- **CSL Grain Boundary**: Build cubic bicrystals with explicit Sigma selection and control over GB plane, in-plane replication, translation, and overlap handling.
- **Nanocrystal**: Carve finite particles from loaded reference structures (sphere, ellipsoid, box, cylinder, octahedron, truncated octahedron, cuboctahedron).
- **Nanocrystal (Wulff)**: Build equilibrium-shape nanocrystals from user-supplied Miller-index / surface-energy families with an interactive 3D facet preview.
- **Custom Structure**: Fill imported mesh volumes (OBJ/STL) with atoms from a reference crystal, with side-by-side 3D previews.
- **Polycrystal**: Generate Voronoi-based polycrystalline structures from a reference crystal.

### Merge structures

- Open **Edit -> Merge Structures** to combine multiple structures into one.
- Drag-and-drop supported structure files while the dialog is open.
- Select individual structures in the list or preview, then use the 3D gizmo for translate/rotate.
- Orbit and zoom the preview, optionally show/hide the merged bounding box, then apply **Merge Structures**.

## Builder and analysis details

### Bulk crystal builder

- Organizes space groups by crystal system (triclinic to cubic).
- Applies system-specific lattice constraints and trigonal settings.
- Expands asymmetric-unit atoms using symmetry operations to produce full unit cells.

### Substitutional solid solution builder

- Accepts a host structure from the current scene or by drag-and-drop file.
- Composition is specified per element in atomic percent (at%) with a draggable field; Ctrl+click to type exact values.
- Adjusting one element scales all others proportionally so the total always remains 100 at%.
- Integer atom counts are derived via the largest-remainder method to guarantee they sum exactly to the total.
- Atom positions and the unit cell are fully preserved; only element assignments are randomised.

### CSL grain boundary builder

- Designed for cubic grain boundary studies in metallurgy.
- Generates Sigma candidates from rotation axis input.
- Controls GB plane, dimensions, replication, overlap removal, and rigid translation.

### Nanocrystal builder

- Carves finite structures from loaded references.
- Supports sphere, ellipsoid, box, cylinder, octahedron, truncated octahedron, and cuboctahedron geometries.
- Supports Wulff construction from Miller-index facet families and relative surface energies.
- Uses spglib symmetry expansion for Wulff families and supports non-cubic periodic reference cells.
- Includes a dedicated 3D Wulff preview with editable facet colors and black face-boundary lines for readability.
- Can auto-replicate periodic inputs and apply vacuum padding.

### Polycrystal builder

- Uses unit-cell-aware reference structures.
- Builds grains via Voronoi tessellation in a user-defined box.
- Supports random, explicit, and mixed orientation assignment.

### Custom structure builder

- Accepts drag-and-drop crystal and mesh inputs.
- Provides live 3D previews for both reference crystal and mesh model.
- Produces finite atomistic structures constrained by the model volume.

### Crystal orientation coloring

- View -> Color Structure By -> Crystal Orientation switches from element colors to cubic IPF-Z colors.
- Displays an IPF triangle legend in the main view when active.
- Saves companion `basename.atomforge-ipf` metadata when IPF data is available.
- Restores from sidecar metadata on load when present, with geometry-based fallback otherwise.

### Analysis tools

- **Common Neighbour Analysis (CNA)**: Classifies local motifs (FCC, HCP, BCC, ICO) with Honeycutt-Andersen-style signatures.
- **Radial Distribution Function (RDF)**: Provides species filtering, normalization, smoothing, and first-peak analysis.
- **Coordination and bonding**: Includes automatic bond detection, PBC-aware coordination counting, and bond-length statistics.

## Display and measurement

- Bonds are inferred from covalent radii and rendered as split-color cylinders.
- Periodic image atoms are shown at cell boundaries for periodic context.
- Distance and angle tools draw overlays directly in the scene.
- Atom Info reports element, Cartesian/direct coordinates, and bond statistics.
- View -> Select Theme supports dark and light themes with matching overlay colors.
- UI scales automatically for high-resolution and HiDPI displays.
