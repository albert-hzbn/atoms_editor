# AtomForge

AtomForge is an atomic structure builder for metallurgical simulation and atomistic modeling. It provides interactive tools for constructing, editing, and analyzing periodic crystals, grain boundaries, and nanostructures—all essential for preparing input structures for molecular dynamics and first-principles computational materials science.

## Core capabilities

- **Build structures from scratch** using crystal-system-aware builders for bulk crystals, cubic grain boundaries, and nanocrystals.
- **Edit and refine** atoms and lattice parameters interactively, with real-time visualization.
- **Create metallurgical defects** such as grain boundaries with explicit Sigma selection and in-plane replication.
- **Carve finite nanostructures** from any loaded reference structure using geometric shapes.
- **Analyze local order** with common-neighbour analysis and radial distribution functions.
- **Export for simulation** in VASP, LAMMPS, and other popular MD and DFT formats.
- **Inspect structure quality** through coordination statistics, symmetry detection, and lattice metrics.

## Platform support

- Linux
- Windows via MSYS2 UCRT64 / MinGW-w64

## Quick start

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libglm-dev \
                 libopenbabel-dev libopenbabel3 libsymspg-dev

cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/AtomForge
./build/AtomForge structure.cif
```

### Windows (MSYS2 UCRT64)

Install MSYS2, open the UCRT64 shell, then run:

```bash
pacman -Syu
# close and reopen the UCRT64 shell, then run
pacman -Su

pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain \
                  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake \
                  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-glfw \
                  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-glew \
                  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-glm \
                  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-openbabel \
                  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-pkgconf

# optional: enables symmetry features through spglib
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-spglib

cmake -S . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/AtomForge.exe
./build/AtomForge.exe structure.cif
```

Note: run the Windows build from the MSYS2 UCRT64 shell. PowerShell will often miss the required toolchain and DLL paths.

## Build notes

- The project uses CMake and targets C++11.
- OpenGL 3.x, GLFW, GLEW, GLM, and Open Babel are required.
- spglib or symspg is optional; if found, symmetry-related features are enabled automatically.

To clean the current build tree:

```bash
cmake --build build --target clean
```

To remove all generated artifacts:

```bash
rm -rf build
```

## Portable Builds

Build portable packages that bundle all dependencies (no system library dependencies required at runtime).

### Windows Portable

Build a portable ZIP package with bundled DLLs:

```bash
# In MSYS2 UCRT64 shell:
cmake -S . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_PORTABLE=ON
cmake --build build -j

# Create a portable ZIP package:
cd build
cpack -G ZIP
```

This generates `AtomForge-1.0.0-win64.zip` containing the executable and all required DLLs. Extract it anywhere and run `AtomForge.exe` without any further installation.

**Manual portable package:**
```bash
mkdir AtomForge-portable
cd AtomForge-portable
cp ../build/Release/AtomForge.exe .
cp ../README.md .
# Copy required DLLs from C:\msys2\ucrt64\bin:
cp C:/msys2/ucrt64/bin/glfw3.dll .
cp C:/msys2/ucrt64/bin/glew32.dll .
cp C:/msys2/ucrt64/bin/openbabel3.dll .
# For spglib support (if available):
cp C:/msys2/ucrt64/bin/spglib.dll .
cp C:/msys2/ucrt64/bin/symspg.dll .
cd ..
7z a AtomForge-portable.zip AtomForge-portable/
```

### Linux Portable (Tarball + Bundled Libraries)

Build a portable tarball for easy distribution:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_PORTABLE=ON
cmake --build build -j
cd build
cpack -G TGZ
```

This generates `AtomForge-1.0.0-Linux.tar.gz` with the executable ready to run.

**Manual portable tarball with bundled libs:**
```bash
mkdir -p AtomForge-portable/lib
cd AtomForge-portable

# Copy executable
cp ../build/AtomForge .
cp ../README.md .

# Copy runtime libraries (adjust paths as needed for your system)
# Find library locations:
# ldd ../build/AtomForge  # to see which libraries to copy
ldd ../build/AtomForge | grep "=> /" | awk '{print $3}' | sort -u > libs.txt

# Copy essential libraries (GLFW, GLEW, OpenBabel, OpenGL, etc.):
cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglfw.so.3 lib/
cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLEW.so.2.2 lib/
cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libopenbabel.so.3 lib/
cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so.1 lib/
cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX.so.0 lib/

cd ..
tar czf AtomForge-portable.tar.gz AtomForge-portable/
```

To run the portable Linux package:
```bash
tar xzf AtomForge-portable.tar.gz
cd AtomForge-portable
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./AtomForge
```

### Alternative: Build for System Installation

For standard system-wide installation (requires dependencies on target machine):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j install
```

On Linux, this installs to `/usr/local/bin` (may require `sudo`).

## Supported formats

**Structure files** (open and save): `.xyz`, `.cif`, `.pdb`, `.sdf`, `.mol`, `.vasp`, `.mol2`, `.pwi`, `.gjf`

**Rendered images**: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`

You can also open a structure directly at launch by passing the file path as the first argument, for example `AtomForge structure.cif`.

3. Toggle View -> Show Bonds and View -> Show Element as needed.
4. Open View -> Structure Info for composition, lattice, positions, and symmetry.

### Edit atoms and structure data

- Right-click a selection to substitute atoms, insert an atom at a midpoint, measure, or delete.
- Use Edit -> Edit Structure to modify lattice vectors and atom positions.
- Use Edit -> Atomic Sizes and Edit -> Element Colors to tune radii, colors, and shininess.
- Use Edit -> Transform Structure to apply a 3x3 matrix to periodic structures.

### Build and construct structures

- **Bulk Crystal**: Generate periodic cells from crystal system, space group, lattice parameters, and asymmetric-unit atoms. Ideal for preparing supercells and commensurate structures.
- **CSL Grain Boundary**: Construct cubic bicrystals with explicit Sigma selection from sc, bcc, fcc, or diamond source lattices. Control GB plane, in-plane replication, rigid translation, and overlap removal.
- **Nanocrystal**: Carve finite particles from any loaded reference structure using sphere, ellipsoid, box, cylinder, octahedron, truncated octahedron, or cuboctahedron geometry. Apply auto-centering and optional unit-cell padding.

## Structure builders and analysis

AtomForge's builder system is designed to prepare structures for atomistic simulation—from perfect crystals to defected metallurgical systems.

### Bulk crystal builder

- Organizes space groups by crystal system (triclinic through cubic).
- Applies system-specific lattice constraints and trigonal settings.
- Expands asymmetric-unit atoms using symmetry operations to build the full unit cell.
- Perfect for creating supercells and preparing input for vasp, LAMMPS, and quantum espresso.

### CSL grain boundary builder

- Targeted at metallurgical simulation of grain boundaries in cubic systems.
- Generates sigma-list candidates from a rotation axis; select explicitly by Sigma, m, n, and angle.
- Controls GB plane, supercell dimensions, in-plane replication, overlap removal, and rigid translation.
- Outputs bicrystal structures ready for MD or DFT study of interface properties.

### Nanocrystal builder

- Carves finite particles from any loaded reference structure.
- Supports geometric shapes: sphere, ellipsoid, box, cylinder, octahedron, truncated octahedron, cuboctahedron.
- Auto-replicates periodic inputs for efficient particle generation and can pad with vacuum.
- Ideal for preparing nanoparticle input for cluster simulations and nanoscale property calculations.

### Structure analysis

- **Common Neighbour Analysis**: Identifies local crystalline environments (FCC, HCP, BCC, ICO) and reports Honeycutt-Andersen-style pair signatures.
- **Radial Distribution Function**: Plots RDF with species filters, normalization, smoothing, and first-peak analysis for structure validation.
- **Coordination and bonding**: Automatic bond detection, PBC-aware coordination counting, and bond-length statistics for quality assurance.

## Display and measurements

- Bonds are inferred from covalent radii and rendered as split-color cylinders.
- Periodic image atoms are drawn at cell boundaries for periodic visualization.
- Distance and angle tools draw helper overlays in the scene.
- Atom Info reports element data, Cartesian and direct coordinates, and bond statistics.

## Windows troubleshooting

### Open Babel plugin path is missing

If AtomForge reports that Open Babel plugins cannot be found, set the plugin path before launch:

```bash
export BABEL_LIBDIR=/ucrt64/lib/openbabel/3.1.0/
```

If you moved/cloned the project and loading any structure fails, this is usually the reason.
Use the actual installed plugin directory for your Open Babel version, for example:

```bash
# Linux examples
export BABEL_LIBDIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openbabel/3.1.1/
export BABEL_LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/openbabel/3.1.1/

# MSYS2 UCRT64 examples
export BABEL_LIBDIR=/ucrt64/lib/openbabel/3.1.1/
export BABEL_LIBDIR=/ucrt64/lib/openbabel/3.1.0/
```

Quick check:

```bash
echo $BABEL_LIBDIR
ls "$BABEL_LIBDIR"
```

### Missing DLLs at startup

Run from the UCRT64 shell, or ensure `C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin` is present in `PATH`.

### CMake cannot find dependencies

Verify that `pkgconf` and the required MSYS2 packages are installed in the same UCRT64 environment used for the build.
